	<h2 id="Impetus"><a href="#Impetus">Impetus</a></h2>
	<p>There are many beautiful art pieces, camps, and moments which are made harder to immerse oneself in by nearby amplified sounds.  Many artists and burners would like to have a safe space away from these loud sounds, while still having art and an open community, and without infringing on anyones right to make noise.</p>
	<!-- <p>There is a lot of beautiful art and moments that are hard to absorb and be present in amidst the sensory onslaught of sound systems at Burning Man.  Many art pieces deserve an area of average sound levels for the sake of both the participants and the artists who endeavored to create, transport, and share their piece with the community.  Many burners would like to see art in a calmer area.</p> -->

	<p>Radical Inclusion is a tricky concept when related to entities which can dominate over one another.  In this case, a large sound system and many surrounding art pieces, camps, or connections.  The sense of feeling respected, welcome, and at home is lost when one group feels opressed by the wants of another.  To tell either the loud to be quiet or the not so loud to just deal with it is, unfortunately, going to leave someone feeling radically unincluded.  For any true solution, we should neither rule out calm beauty nor chaotic expression, even though they are so frequently difficult to combine.</p>


	<!-- <p>Radical inclusion is a tricky concept when related to entities which can dominate over one another.  In this case, a large sound system and many surrounding art pieces or camps.  Sound moves people, whether they want it or not.  Radical inclusion undeniably extends to every group with a sound system and the desire to throw a great party, but it can also be, and often is, at the cost of those nearby.  Burning Man is one of the most sensory heavy places on Earth, it is hard to handle for quiet, relaxed, or exhausted types.  A common and thoughtful thread of doubt in the event exists, and it is centered mostly around the feeling that by having a preference for relaxing atmospheres we have no safe place beyond the few hours surrounding sunrise, the far out suburbs, and occasionally deep playa.</p> -->

	<!-- <p>Radical inclusion is a tricky concept when related to entities which can dominate over one another.

	<h2 id="Chattish"><a href="#Chattish">Chattish and Whispish</a></h2>
	<p>In order to talk about this subject, a few words need to be defined:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Chattish</b> - the level of sound when a bunch of people are talking.  Quieter than constant yelling or amplified music, louder than Whispish.</li>
		<li><b>Whispish</b> - the level of sound in a Library, or the Temple</li>
	</ul>
	</p>


	<h2 id="Existing_Cohabitation_Styles"><a href="#Existing_Cohabitation_Styles">Existing Cohabitation Styles</a></h2>
	<p>There are a few basic known ways of somewhat combining uncombinable things:
	<ol>
		<li><b>Alternating</b>: The two are given turns.  Chattish/loud hours are set.  Sound curfews at Burning Man are simply a bad idea.</li>
		<li><b>Parallelism</b>: The two things are seperated by personal perspective.  Requires people to hear the quiet through the loud and vice versa.  Current solution.</li>
		<li><b>Separation</b>:  The two are separated.  Chattish/loud spaces are defined.  To some degree, this has already happened with the further out streets, but it's still a crapshoot whether or not a you'll end up next to a sound camp.</li>
	</ol>
	</p>


	<!-- <h2 id="Existing_Cohabitation_Styles"><a href="#Existing_Cohabitation_Styles">Existing Cohabitation Styles</a></h2>
	<p>There are complex and simple solutions.  For the sake of showing the vastness of them, in order of least applicable to most, here are the things which have been applied at other events:
	<ol>
		<li>Parallel Channels:  A massive silent disco movement.  Everyone collectively decides to bring headphones and a radio, creating the ability to choose between sounds, but forgoing bass and adding one more thing to hang around the neck.</li>
		<li>Alternating Channels:  We take turns.  Quiet and loud hours are set, perhaps in a rotating pattern which pushes people around as they either follow the raging party or the jovial one.</li>
		<li>Separate Channels:  Spaces are made which have slightly stricter but still not really that strict sound limits.  </li>
	</ol></p> -->



	<br>
	<div id="Disclaimer">
		<h2><a href="#Disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></h2>
		<p>Following is a potential solution, but it is not what lies at the core of this proposal.  The core of this is that 
		we, as a community, need to work together and keep as many people as possible feeling included.  Beyond that core issue is the fact that many people who prefer a little peace are starting to feel displaced.  If you do not like the proposed solution, please <a href="#We_Might_Be_Wrong">give your reasons and perhaps a new solution</a>.  Community is built by discussion, and this proposal is just a topic piece.

		<p>There are many solutions on how to include two things which can not overlap happily.  It is not the potential solutions following that matter for those most affected by this, but an answer to the impetus.  If you do not like the solutions which have been proposed thus far, please <a href="#We_Might_Be_Wrong">give your reasons and perhaps a new solution</a>.  There is no way for a few people to know what is best for an entire community without some crazy download other peoples' experiences machine.  So for now, let's resort to <a href="#We_Might_Be_Wrong">group discussion</a>.</p> 
	</div>
	<br> -->


	<h2 id="The_Idea"><a href="#The_Idea">The Idea</a></h2>
	<div class="blurb whitebox">
	"[a place for those] who come to Burning Man looking for quiet beauties and calm, creative community."
	</div>
	<p>Whilst walking down L street on 3:00 side, taking in the amazing scenery, the wind, the peace of many small camps setting up for dinner, still an hour till sunset, the thought arose: if only the art could be here too.  And why not?  Why not have a small, open, and relatively calm space for artists who choose it to place their art?  They could become epicenters for the relaxed and communal, the tea and yoga camps, acoustic performances, Zendo psychedelic harm reduction, nap areas, ball pits, blanket forts, Medics, Rangers, retired Burners, and everything and everyone else who comes to Burning Man looking for quiet beauties and calm, creative community.</p>


	<!-- <h2 id="Our_Idea"><a href="#Our_Idea">Our Idea</a></h2>
	<p>This idea came up whilst walking down L street:  What if there was a small open space that artists could choose to put their art up in...  What if they could become the epicenters of quietish camps such as tea, yoga, acoustic performance, Zendo psychedelic harm reduction, nap areas, ball pits, blanket forts, Medical, Rangers, old school burners, or anything else which might be better without a nearby <a href="snarktionary.html" class="easter_egg">throbber</a>...  Wouldn't it be nice to know where you could go every year to find these things... Wouldn't it be nice to be able to make a camp with assurance that your neighbors won't be blasting banana phone every single morning for the whole week (with their speakers pointed outward, no less!).</p>
 -->


 	<h2 id="Working_Name"><a href="#Working_Name">The Working Name</a></h2>
 	<p>The current working name for these spaces is "No Wake Zones."  Something had to be chosen for the domain name, who knows what it will be in the end.  The basic ideology behind these is that they are places where people feel free to talk and occasionally yell, but it would inconsiderate to blast your music way louder than it needs to be for hours on end.  In order to get camp placement there are a few extra rules, such as pointing your speakers inward and keeping them below a certain level, especially during the most disrespectful hours.  There should be some sort of signage which lets art cars know they are entering a No Wake Zone, and a prior knowledge of what that means.  And most of all, there should be enough space to house all the art of the many artists who would prefer to have their pieces in an area that is more community centered and less loud and destructive.</p>


	<!-- <h2 id="No_Wake_Zones"><a href="#No_Wake_Zones">No Wake Zones</a></h2>
	<p>Areas large enough to house multiple art pieces, open enough to give them space, and surrounded with some form of signage.  The ideals are simple: please considerately don't make a whole bunch of noise.  In the spirit of freedom there shouldn't have to be rules, but for the camp placement.  Of the rules the most lax version might be that if you have speakers, point them inwards and keep them below some level which is loud enough to dance to and feel, but not so loud it can't be ignored.  If you have an art car and you're driving through a "No Wake Zone" area, turn your tunes down so <i><b>you</b></i> can hear them.  If you have a loudspeaker, hold off on your funnies for a bit. Etc.</p> -->


	<!-- <h2 id="Not_Quiet_Camp"><a href="#Not_Quiet_Camp">This is not Quiet Camp</a></h2>
	<p>Burningman is still a huge <a href="snarktionary.html" class="easter_egg">pARTy</a>.  The idea that these spaces should be incredibly silent would only create another uncomfortable extreme.  Sound camps are still okay, as are sound cars, and sound people.  It may still be a bit loud at times, but as a general measure if you put in ear plugs it should be quiet.  You shouldn't have to raise your voice more than a smidge.  Louder than a library, quieter than a busy bar.  Drunk less crunk.  Sober less somber.</p> -->


	<h2 id="No_Wake_Zone_Placement"><a href="#No_Wake_Zone_Placement">No Wake Zone Placement</a></h2>
	<p>The most complex part of this idea is correct placement.  After much consideration, the open spaces where the arrows point were the best placements and sizing we could think of:

	<br>

	<div id="placement_images">
		<a href="public/images/BM_NoWakeZone_TempleThirds.png">
			<img src="public/images/BM_NoWakeZone_TempleThirds-small.png">(click to zoom)<br>
			centered at 4:00 and 8:00 on India street with a diameter of three blocks, the spaces are both effective and mathematically simple.
		</a>
		<div class="pros_cons whitebox">
			<center><b><u>Why we like this placement and sizing:</u></b></center>
			<ul>
				<li>It interferes with the least amount of theme camps on the map.</li>
				<li>Is is midway between the center camp and sound camp areas.</li>
				<li>It incentives city wide suburban exploration.</li>
				<li>It is large enough to comfortably fit multiple art pieces and create a sense of open space.</li>
				<li>It uses the number three which is the only other prime factor of twelve (2 * 2 * 3).</li>
				<li>By splitting the circle into thirds starting at the temple, it creates an underlying pattern that relates it to the temple and the man in a similar way as center camp is related (halves/thirds).</li>
				<li>It is very far from the Esplanade, 2:00 and 10:00, and A/B street high energy zones.</li>
				<li>It is two blocks away from the outer ring, making it easy to avoid for incoming cars.</li>
				<li>It will be easier to MOOP than open playa.</li>
				<li>It opens up great placement for newer camps without having to displace any older ones</li>
				<li>It neither interferes with nor requires the creation of roads.  People can pass through in the same way as open playa.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</div>	




	<h2 id="We_Might_Be_Wrong"><a href="#We_Might_Be_Wrong">We Might Be Wrong</a></h2>
	<p>
		The Temple Thirds Placement was the best solution we could think of, but we also realize it is unlikely to be the final one.  And not just the placement, but the ideals, potential rule set, and name are all just our contributions to what hopefully becomes a community wide discussion and creation.  As said in the disclaimer, all that really matters is an answer to the impetus, that no group of people should be made to feel like their wants are not important.

		On a more personal note, thank you for reading these words.  It's been pretty amazing so far and if there's one thing we've grown to love at burning man, it is those serene moments where you're transported to another world.  The ones created by so many peoples imaginations, things that only they could ever share.  We hope through this proposal and any and all help, we can all craft a place in which artists get to share their worlds, and people get to get lost in them. <br>
