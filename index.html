<h1>Did you know... </h1>
that the 4:30 @ G and 7:30 @ G plazas are <i>Art Plazas</i>?  Did you also know that not all art is best experienced to the sound of oft ill chosen dance music?

<h1>Impetus</h1>
There is a lot of beautiful art that is hard to absorb and experience amidst the sensory onslaught of huge sound systems.  Many art pieces deserve an area of average sound levels for the sake of both the participants and the artists who endeavored to create, transport, and share their piece with the community.  Many burners would like to enjoy art in a calmer area.

<h1>Radical Inclusion</h1>
Radical inclusion is a tricky concept when related to entities which can dominate over other entities.  In this case, one large sound system in an unpreferable place can disrupt the peace of many surrounding art pieces, or camps.  At the same time, it can also be creating a rad party, a night many will never forget.  Radical inclusion undeniably extends to every being with a sound system and dreams of throwing the biggest party of their lives, but at the cost of those who might not like their music, tastes, and general passion for being completely impossible to ignore.  Of the burners I know and love, a common thread of doubt in the event exists, and it is centered mostly around the feeling that by having a preference for relaxing atmospheres we have no place beyond the few hours surrounding sunrise, the far out suburbs, and occasionally deep playa.



<h1>Existing Cohabitation Styles</h1>
There are complex and simple solutions.  For the sake of showing the vastness of them, in order of least applicable to most, here are the things which have worked before:
1. Parallel Channels:  A massive silent disco movement.  Everyone collectively decides to bring headphones and a radio, creating the ability to choose between sounds, but forgoing bass and adding one more thing to hang around the neck.
2. Alternating Channels:  We take turns.  Quiet and loud hours are set, perhaps in a rotating pattern which pushes people around as they either follow the raging party or the jovial one.
3. Seperate Channels:  Spaces are made which have slightly stricter but still not really that strict sound limits.  


<h1>Disclamer</h1>
There are many solutions on how to include two things which can not overlap happily.  It is not the potential solutions following that matter but an answer to the impetus.  If you do not like the solutions which have been proposed thus far, please give your reasons and perhaps a new solution.  There is no way for a few people to know what is best for an entire community without some crazy download other peoples' experiences machine.  So for now, let's resort to group discussion. 



<h1>Our Idea</h1>
This idea came up whilst walking down G street:  What if there was a couple small open spaces that artists could choose to put their art up in...  What if they could become the epicenters of quiet camps such as tea palaces, yoga, non-amplified music, nap areas, ball pits, blanket forts, or anything else which might be better without a nearby throbber...  Wouldn't it be nice to know where you could go every year to find these things... Wouldn't it be nice to be able to make a camp with assurance that your neighbors won't be blasting banana phone every single morning for the whole week (with their speakers pointed outward, no less!).

<h1>No Wake Zones</h1>
Areas large enough to house multiple art pieces, open enough to give them space, and surrounded with "No Wake Zone" signage.  The ideals are simple: please considerately don't make a whole bunch of noise.  In the spirit of freedom there shouldn't have to be rules, but for the placement.  Of the rules the most lax version might be that if you have speakers, point them inwards and keep them below some level which is loud enough to dance to and feel, but not so loud it can't be ignored.  If you have an art car and you're driving through a "No Wake Zone" area, turn your tunes down so <i><b>you</b></i> can hear it.  If you have a loudspeaker, save up your funnies.  If you need to make noise, there's a city for that.  Etc.

<h1>This is not Quiet Camp</h1>
Burningman is still a huge pARTy.  The idea that these spaces should be incredibly silent would only create another uncomfortable extreme.  Sound camps are still okay, as are sound cars, and sound people.  It may still be a bit loud at times, relative to the suburbs.  But as a general measure, if you put in ear plugs it should be quiet.  You shouldn't have to raise your voice more than a smidge.  Louder than a library, quieter than a busy bar.  Drunk not crunk.  Sober not somber.  Trippin out not flippin out.
