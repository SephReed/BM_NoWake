	<p><i>Peaceful epicenters beyond center camp.</i></p>


	<h2 id="Impetus"><a href="#Impetus">Impetus</a></h2>
	<p>There are many beautiful art pieces, camps, and moments which are made harder to immerse oneself in by nearby amplified sounds.  Many artists and burners would like to have a safe space away from these loud sounds, while still having art and an open community, and without infringing on anyones right to make noise.</p>

	<div class="blurb whitebox">
	"Telling either the loud to be quiet or the quiet to adapt is going to leave someone feeling radically unincluded"
	</div>

	<p>Radical Inclusion is <b>a tricky concept with entities which can dominate over one another</b>.  In this case, a large sound system and many surrounding art pieces, camps, or connections.  The sense of feeling respected, welcome, and at home is lost when one group feels opressed by the wants of another.  Telling either the loud to be quiet or the quiet to adapt is going to leave someone feeling radically unincluded.  For any true solution, both extremes must feel welcome.</p>


	<!-- <h2 id="Chattish"><a href="#Chattish">Chattish and Whispish</a></h2>
	<p>In order to talk about this subject, a few words need to be defined:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Chattish</b> - the level of sound when a bunch of people are talking.  Quieter than constant yelling or amplified music, louder than Whispish.</li>
		<li><b>Whispish</b> - the level of sound in a Library, or the Temple</li>
	</ul>
	</p> -->


	<h2 id="Existing_Cohabitation_Styles"><a href="#Existing_Cohabitation_Styles">Existing Cohabitation Styles</a></h2>
	<p>There are a common ways of combining opposing things:
	<ol>
		<li><b>Alternating</b>: The two are given turns.  Chatty vs blasty hours are set.  (Would require sound curfews, probably not a popular idea)</li>
		<li><b>Forced cooperation/competition</b>: The two things are set against eachother and forced to settle it themselves.  (Current solution)</li>
		<li><b>Separation</b>:  The two are separated.  Chatty vs blasty spaces are defined.  (To some degree, this has already happened with the further out streets, but it's still a gamble)</li>
	</ol>
	</p>



	<br>
	<div id="Disclaimer">
		<h2><a href="#Disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></h2>
		<p>Following is a potential solution, but it is not the core of this proposal.  The core of this is that being inclusive means not letting the loudest burners take everyone elses voice.  Many people who prefer a little peace are starting to feel displaced.  If you do not like the proposed solution, please <a href="#We_Might_Be_Wrong">give your reasons and perhaps a new solution</a>.  Community is built by discussion, and this proposal is just a spark in that fire.

	<h2 id="The_Idea"><a href="#The_Idea">The Inspiration</a></h2>
	<div class="blurb whitebox">
	"A place for those who come to Burning Man looking for quiet beauties and calm, creative community."
	</div>
	<p>L street is great place to get away from the noise.  You can hear the wind, the sounds of small camps chatting, a little excitement in their voice, the occasional laugh, and even the person you're trying to talk to.  What if Burning Man's art could be experienced in a place like that?
	<br>
	<b>Our dream</b> is to have peaceful epicenters for <i>anyone who's tired of the playa soundscape</i> and many quiet type camps such as: the tea and yoga camps, acoustic performances, Zendo psychedelic harm reduction, nap areas, ball pits, blanket forts, Medics, Rangers, retired Burners, etc.  A place for those who come to Burning Man looking for quiet beauties and calm, creative community.  
	<br>
	<b>Our proposal</b> is to create miniature esplanades, similar to keyholes, but large enough to house multiple full size art pieces and far enough out to have little amplified sound interfering with them.  The new deep playa.</p>



 	<h2 id="Working_Name"><a href="#Working_Name">The Working Name and Rules</a></h2>
 	<p>The current working name for these spaces is "No Wake Zones.""  The gist is, don't blast amplified sound here.  Yell occasionally, play your music at personal hearing levels, point your speakers inwards if you can... essentially, don't bombard others with your sound.  Pretty simple.  These spaces would require some sort of signage to let art cars know when they are entering/exiting them so they can change amplification.  A no-wake sign along the roads leading in might suffice.  The interior of them would be treated similar to open playa, and the outer edge similar to esplanade.  It is very unlikely burnable art would be safe in such a space, but they would otherwise be very similar to mini Burning Mans unto themselves.</p>

 	<!-- The basic ideology behind these is that they are places where people feel free to talk and occasionally yell, but it would inconsiderate to blast your music way louder than it needs to be for hours on end.  In order to get camp placement there are a few extra rules, such as pointing your speakers inward and keeping them below a certain level, especially during the most disrespectful hours.  There should be some sort of signage which lets art cars know they are entering a No Wake Zone, and a prior knowledge of what that means.  And most of all, there should be enough space to house all the art of the many artists who would prefer to have their pieces in an area that is more community centered and less loud and destructive. -->




	<h2 id="No_Wake_Zone_Placement"><a href="#No_Wake_Zone_Placement">No Wake Zone Placement</a></h2>
	<p>The most complex part of this idea is space and placement.  After much consideration, the open spaces where the arrows point were the best placements and sizing we could think of:

	<br>

	<div id="placement_images">
		<a href="public/images/BM_NoWakeZone_TempleThirds.png">
			<img src="public/images/BM_NoWakeZone_TempleThirds-small.png">(click to zoom)<br>
			centered at 4:00 and 8:00 on India street with a diameter of three blocks, the spaces are both effective and mathematically simple.
		</a>
		<div class="pros_cons whitebox">
			<center><b><u>Why we like this placement and sizing:</u></b></center>
			<ul>
				<li>It interferes with the least amount of theme camps on the map.</li>
				<li>It is large enough to comfortably fit multiple art pieces and create a sense of open space (roughly center camps outer size).</li>
				<li>It incentives city wide suburban exploration!</li>
				<li>Is is midway between the center camp and sound camp areas, deep burbs territory.</li>
				<li>By splitting the circle into thirds starting at the temple, it creates an underlying pattern that relates it to the temple and the man in a similar way as center camp is related (halves/thirds).</li>
				<li>It uses the number three which is the only other prime factor of twelve (2 * 2 * 3).</li>
				<li>It is very far from the Esplanade, 2:00 and 10:00, and A/B street high energy zones.</li>
				<li>It is two blocks away from the outer ring, making it easy to avoid for incoming cars.</li>
				<li>It will be easier to MOOP than open playa.</li>
				<li>It opens up great placement for newer camps without having to displace any older ones.  Doubly true for quiet type camps.</li>
				<li>It neither interferes with nor requires the creation of roads.  People can pass through in the same way as open playa.</li>
			</ul>

	<!-- <h2 id="We_Might_Be_Wrong"><a href="#We_Might_Be_Wrong">We Might Be Wrong</a></h2>
	<p>
		The Temple Thirds Placement was the best solution we could think of, but we also realize it is unlikely to be the final one.  And not just the placement, but the ideals, potential rule set, and name are all just our contributions to what hopefully becomes a community wide discussion and creation.  As said in the disclaimer, all that really matters is an answer to the impetus, that no group of people should be made to feel like their wants are not important.

	<p class="fancy">
		On a more personal note, thank you for reading these words.  Our love for burning man has grown from the art, and those serene moments where you're transported to another world created by so many peoples imaginations, things that only they could ever share.  We hope through this proposal a movement may start which will ultimately yield a place in which artists get to share their worlds, and people get to <i>really</i> get lost in them. <br>
		<br>
		Thank you you beautiful, complex, and potentially insane beings,<br>
		Seph and Misty
